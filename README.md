# Hello, World! 

I'm Sebastian, a passionate physicist with a love for neuroscience! Notably, I am very interested in the link between connectivity and activity in the brain, and its ability to self-organize into functional structures. I spend my free time as a part of the *starcode tech team, contributing to the development of courses to teach programming to young students with the goal of motivating more women to choose a career in the STEM field.
